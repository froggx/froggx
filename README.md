- 😴 Hi, I’m @froggx
- ☢ I’m interested in cybersecurity && gaming.
- ✒ I’m currently learning pentesting. I passed CompTIA Pentest+ PT1-002 Beta exam last year. I also have an MS in Cybersecurity Mgt.
- 🍻 I'm currently looking for a sensei to help me level up my pentesting. My EXP is low.
- 👻 How to reach me ... just post an issue or a PR for now. I'm still learning about git. Webhooks are my friends, maybe.
